Clients who subscribe to an event trigger do not need to initiate a request. They are notified when the event occurs. This is similar to keeping up with the latest world news on the internet. You can initiate the request for data by opening a news website in your browser, or you can subscribe to a mail list to receive the latest news as it happens."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"when-to-use-triggers",children:"When to Use Triggers"}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It is best to use event triggers when you need to react to an event in real-time.

Event triggers use less bandwidth, they do not affect your API rate limit, and they are as close as you can get to real-time. However, event triggers have downsides to consider. They must be accessible from the public internet so the trigger service knows where to send the notification, and they can be harder to configure and operate than APIs are."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"how-to-get-started-with-event-triggers",children:"How to Get Started With Event Triggers"}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Event triggers require different setup and testing steps than APIs do, so you should follow each document to better understand event triggers and the necessary steps to configure one.
